The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.child:hover {
  color: green;
}

.parent .child {
  color: purple;
}
```

In this example, the `.child` element inherits the `color: blue` from its parent. The `!important` declaration on `.child` overrides the inherited color, making the text red. However, the `:hover` pseudo-class has higher specificity than the `!important` rule, causing the text to change to green on hover. Finally, the more specific selector `.parent .child` has even higher specificity than the `!important` rule, causing the text to turn purple. The conflict between `!important` and specificity can lead to unexpected behavior.
