The solution avoids using `!important` altogether by restructuring the CSS rules to leverage the natural specificity of CSS selectors.  A more specific selector is created to target the desired styling, thereby eliminating the conflict:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.parent .child {
  color: purple;
}

.parent .child:hover {
  color: green;
}
```

This revised CSS ensures that the styles are applied predictably based on the hierarchy and specificity of the selectors. This approach promotes clean, maintainable, and understandable CSS.
